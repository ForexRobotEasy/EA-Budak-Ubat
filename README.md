# EA Budak Ubat

This is the code for the EA Budak Ubat, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA Budak Ubat is a trading robot designed to analyze the trend of a chart and initiate trades based on the Execution Mode parameter.

## Functionality

The code consists of several functions that perform different tasks:

1. `InitiateTrade()` - This function analyzes the Execution Mode parameter to determine the type of trade to be initiated based on the trend of the chart. It checks if there are no existing trades on the chart and initiates a trade accordingly.

2. `SetStopLoss()` - This function sets a stop-loss order at a specific distance from the opened trade price. It checks if the stop-loss variable is greater than 0 and sets the stop-loss order accordingly.

3. `CheckExistingPositions()` - This function checks for existing positions on the chart and analyzes the last position. If the last position is in loss, it calculates the distance between the current market price and the order. Based on this distance, it implements necessary trading functions and takes appropriate actions.

4. `OnInit()` - This is the main entry point of the program. It initializes necessary variables and parameters.

5. `OnTick()` - This is the entry point for each tick. It calls the `InitiateTrade()`, `SetStopLoss()`, and `CheckExistingPositions()` functions to analyze the Execution Mode parameter, set stop-loss orders, and check for existing positions.
